# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it is the writing of codes to make softwares such as applications, websites etc with view of solving real world problems
It helps automate some really heavy tasks and easier management of quit heavy data.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the development of internet and rise of web and mobile application development   2.   The introduction of object oriented programing with the use of c++ 
3. the rise and development of various programing languages that are easy to use(high level) and generate user friendly interfaces
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- identifying the problem or the client requirement and the necessary tools and how to go about
analysis-collecting the neccessary infomation and the requirements 
design- eg the user interface 
coding- writing the actual lines of code that operate the software behind the scenes
testing- checking whether it works and it meets the need and is upto the purpose
maintenance - the continuous advancement,updating  and dealing with arising challenges and problems
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method - a linear, sequential approach where each phase of the SDLC is completed before moving to the next.
Agile method -iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and adaptability
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developers-  responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining the code that forms the software application.
quality assurance-  for ensuring that the software meets quality standards and functions as intended
project manager-  planning, executing, and monitoring the software development project
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They offer features like code editors, debuggers, compilers, and build automation, reducing the need for separate tools.
IDEs improve code quality by providing features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and real-time error detection
They provide a comprehensive set of tools within a single interface, streamlining the development process.
IDEs boost productivity by automating repetitive tasks and providing efficient tools for code navigation and refactoring
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-the continuous evolution of technology - overcomed by continuous learning and involvement 
-Shortcuts and quick fixes can accumulate, creating technical debt that hinders future development - Dedicate time to refactor code and improve its quality and regular code reviews
Time constraints and deadlines - effective time management and realistic estimates for project's completion
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on testing individual units or components of the software in isolation
Integration testing verifies the interactions between different units or components of the software
System testing evaluates the complete, integrated system against its specified requirements
Acceptance testing is performed to determine whether the system meets the end-users' needs and expectations
importance: early defect detection
improved software quality
enhnced user satisfaction

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively guide AI models toward generating desired outputs
the art of making more detailed and descriptive input questions
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
